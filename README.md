# Introduction to MongoDB

Welcome to the README, where you will get to know about the basics of the very well known "M" in MERN or MEAN, i.e., the MongoDB

#### Prerequisite - Repo contains source code from the "The Complete Node.js Course" by the "Code With Mosh" author.

It will be great if you follow the course, but no worries, I have got you covered here with the knowledge that I learned from the author. Stick with README, which won't be length nor cryptic. I hope - we - both grasp something insightful from this. Let's jump in!

### WTH is MongoDB?

Ahh, there is this thing about tech - it never ceases to amaze you, isn't it? How we evolved from SQL database to NoSQL or Not SQL or Not SQL Database is something
to note for. Don't worry, I am not taking you back in time. My Point is to familiarize you with these two points here: SQL & NoSQL. 

#### Meet `SQL` -  
 A mechanism to operate or manipulate data that we store in our hardware kinds of stuff. SQL aka relational database means the database that stores data in tabular form.

#### Meet `NoSQL` - 
 A mechanism that deals with data in an anti SQL way. NoSQL, meaning, literally nothing sort of tabular relations. 
 It stores data in other formats including, a highly used [ Key - Value ] pair system ( JSON ), but it's not the only way it handles data. 
 It also uses other data structures such as `Wide-Column Store`, `Graph database` or be that `Document-Oriented Database`. 
 
Now you have that slightest idea of SQL & NoSQL, let's deep dive to know further linking of NoSQL & MongoDB.
